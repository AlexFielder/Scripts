To save a set of drawings in an old format:
-------------------------------------------

Select "SaveAs2004.scr" as the script to apply for the selected
drawing files. This script file will load the "SaveAsOldVer.lsp"
file (make sure you provide the correct path), and runs the
saveas2004 command which saves the opened file in the 2004 DWG
format.


To capture images of a set of drawing files:
--------------------------------------------

Download the "Screenshot for AutoCAD" Plugin of the Month from
Autodesk Labs:

http://labs.autodesk.com/utilities/ADN_plugins/catalog

Follow the instructions provided with this plugin to load it into
AutoCAD: this will cause the plugin to be loaded automatically
whenever the SCREENSHOT command is used (which is the case with
the below script).

Select the "SavePNG.scr" as the script to run for the selected
drawing files. This will, in turn, load the LISP file which
implements the saveasImage_PNG command. Make sure you provide the
correct path.
